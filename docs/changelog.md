# üìù Dev Logs / Experimentation Journal

This file tracks all iterative changes, experiments, and decision logs for the project. Use it to record:
- Approaches tried (successful or not)
- Rationale for decisions
- Lessons learned
- Date-stamped entries for traceability

## Logging Guidelines
- Log every significant experiment, alternative approach, or architectural decision.
- Once a solution becomes core, summarize it in the main docs (README, architecture, workflow, etc.).
- Keep entries concise and factual.

### [2025-Aug-13] Documentation Updates - Core Philosophy Clarification
- **Experiment:** Comprehensive documentation review to align with actual project vision.
- **Implementation:** 
  - Emphasized backend-first, API-centric architecture in all documentation
  - Clarified that frontend is a demo interface, not the core value proposition
  - Documented integration vision for Slack, Teams, ChatOps, and other platforms
  - Added future roadmap for image/GIF/video generation capabilities
  - Highlighted universal API accessibility as key architectural principle
- **Result:** Documentation now accurately reflects the project's true purpose and approach.
- **Decision:** Position the project as a platform-agnostic visual generation API, not just a web app.
- **Lesson:** Documentation must capture the core vision and philosophy, not just the current implementation.

### [2025-Aug-13] Major Frontend UI/UX Overhaul
- **Experiment:** Complete redesign of React frontend with StackEdit-inspired interface.
- **Implementation:** 
  - Added theme support (light/dark/auto) with CSS custom properties
  - Implemented responsive two-column layout (50/50 split)
  - Created circular interactive generate button with loading states
  - Added settings dropdown with theme switching functionality
  - Integrated Heroicons for modern UI elements
  - Applied professional typography and spacing throughout
- **Result:** Transformed basic interface into modern, professional-looking application.
- **Decision:** Maintained backend-first architecture while significantly improving user experience.
