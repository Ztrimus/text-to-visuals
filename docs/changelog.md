# üìù Dev Logs / Experimentation Journal

This file tracks all iterative changes, experiments, and decision logs for the project. Use it to record:
- Approaches tried (successful or not)
- Rationale for decisions
- Lessons learned
- Date-stamped entries for traceability

## Logging Guidelines
- Log every significant experiment, alternative approach, or architectural decision.
- Once a solution becomes core, summarize it in the main docs (README, architecture, workflow, etc.).
- Keep entries concise and factual.
